<em>This glossary provides a robust and comprehensive set of terms that are frequently used in mergers and acquisitions (M&A) within the Digital and Oil & Gas industries. Understanding these key terms is essential for navigating complex M&A transactions, ensuring compliance, and unlocking synergies in these sectors.</em>
</p>

#### **1. Acquisition**

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The process by which one company purchases another, either through cash, stock, or a combination of both, to gain control of the target company's assets and operations.
</p>

#### **2. Anti-Trust**

<p style="text-align: justify;">

</p>

#### **3. Asset Deal**

<p style="text-align: justify;">
A type of acquisition where the buyer purchases specific assets of the target company, rather than acquiring ownership of the entire business. Common in both the Digital sector (software, IP rights) and Oil & Gas sector (wells, pipelines).
</p>

#### **4. Carbon Credits**

#### **5. Capital Expenditure (CapEx)**

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Long-term investments made by a company to acquire or improve fixed assets such as infrastructure, technology, or exploration fields. CapEx is particularly significant in the Oil & Gas industry due to the high costs of exploration and drilling.
</p>

#### **6. Data Room**

</p>

#### **14. Horizontal Integration**

<p style="text-align: justify;">
A type of merger or acquisition where a company acquires a competitor in the same industry. In Digital M&A, this often involves acquiring companies with similar products, while in Oil & Gas, it may involve acquiring additional fields or refineries.
</p>

#### **15. Intellectual Property (IP)**

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Legally recognized creations of the mind, such as inventions, patents, and trademarks. In the Digital sector, IP assets are often a primary driver of M&A, with acquirers seeking to gain ownership of valuable technologies or software.
</p>

#### **16. Joint Venture (JV)**

<p style="text-align: justify;">
A business arrangement in which two or more parties agree to combine their resources for a specific project. JVs are common in the Oil & Gas sector to share risks and resources for exploration and production in challenging regions.
</p>

#### **17. Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG)**

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Natural gas that has been cooled to a liquid state for ease of storage or transport. LNG facilities and infrastructure are often targets in Oil & Gas M&A deals, particularly with increasing global demand for natural gas.
</p>

#### **18. Minority Interest**

The ownership stake in a company held by investors who do not control the business. Understanding minority interest is important in M&A when evaluating the power dynamics of shareholders.
</p>

#### **19. Net Asset Value (NAV)**
