# 18.1. Introduction
<p style="text-align: justify;">
The primary drivers of M&A activities in this industry are the need to acquire valuable assets, enhance geographic reach, and improve operational efficiency. Due to the capital-intensive nature of oil and gas operations, these deals require careful consideration of both immediate financial impacts and the long-term sustainability of the acquisition. This industry faces high upfront costs for exploration, extraction, and infrastructure, which makes mergers and acquisitions a critical tool for gaining competitive advantages. A successful acquisition in this sector requires a deep understanding of both the immediate financial implications and the long-term value it brings in terms of sustainability, market competitiveness, and resilience against global disruptions.

    </div>
</div>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
From a theoretical standpoint, the resource-based view (RBV) of the firm plays a significant role in explaining the motivation behind many oil and gas M&A strategies. The sector is characterized by its capital intensity and reliance on natural resources, making resource acquisition a key driver for companies looking to gain or maintain competitive advantage. In this context, M&A strategies focus on securing valuable physical assets such as oil fields, refineries, and pipeline infrastructure. These acquisitions allow companies to increase production capacity, secure future reserves, and streamline supply chains. Unlike other industries, where acquisitions may focus on market share or consumer bases, oil and gas M&A primarily seeks to control resource flows and secure long-term access to energy supplies, which are critical for market positioning.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
A key aspect of these strategies is the acquisition of assets in new geographic areas, particularly in regions rich in untapped oil reserves. Geopolitical considerations play a substantial role in this process. For example, access to fields in politically stable regions provides not only resource security but also insulation against price volatility and political instability in other regions. Conversely, acquiring assets in emerging markets or politically volatile regions can offer high-reward opportunities but requires sophisticated risk management strategies. This geographic expansion can serve to balance a company‚Äôs portfolio by combining low-risk, low-return assets with high-risk, high-reward opportunities, thus spreading risk across various geographies and political environments. The ability to navigate these geopolitical landscapes through M&A is a distinctive feature of strategy in this sector.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In addition to asset acquisition, oil and gas companies are increasingly focusing on M&A strategies that target technological and operational capabilities. The rise of unconventional extraction techniques‚Äîsuch as hydraulic fracturing (fracking), shale gas extraction, and deep-water drilling‚Äîhas created new frontiers for resource acquisition and production. Acquiring firms with expertise in these areas allows traditional oil and gas companies to leapfrog developmental timelines and capitalize on cutting-edge technologies without incurring the full cost of internal R&D. This also facilitates entry into new markets where these technologies are applicable, such as the prolific shale basins in North America or offshore drilling opportunities in regions like Brazil or the Gulf of Mexico. For example, ExxonMobil‚Äôs acquisition of XTO Energy was largely driven by the strategic goal of entering the shale gas market by leveraging XTO‚Äôs existing expertise in unconventional gas.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Industry best practices highlight that successful oil and gas M&A transactions are not just about resource acquisition but also about the successful integration of the target company‚Äôs operational practices, supply chains, and human capital. Post-merger integration is particularly challenging in this sector due to the complex regulatory environments, the significant differences in operational practices, and the need for maintaining high safety and environmental standards. Effective integration requires a detailed plan that considers operational synergies, cultural alignment, and the ability to leverage the acquired company‚Äôs technical expertise. Companies must also navigate complex regulatory approvals, particularly when the target is located in a different jurisdiction or involves significant market share that may trigger antitrust concerns.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Furthermore, M&A strategies in the oil and gas sector often serve as a hedge against the cyclical nature of the industry, where prices are subject to extreme volatility due to factors like supply and demand imbalances, geopolitical tensions, and environmental regulations. Companies may seek to diversify their asset portfolios to reduce exposure to price fluctuations by investing in a range of energy sources, from conventional oil and gas to renewables. For instance, recent trends have seen major oil companies diversifying into liquefied natural gas (LNG) and renewable energy sectors through acquisitions, as part of their strategy to mitigate the risk of declining oil prices and align with global shifts toward sustainable energy.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Financial considerations are equally critical in oil and gas M&A strategies. These transactions often involve significant leverage and require careful capital allocation strategies. The capital-intensive nature of the industry means that companies must evaluate not only the upfront cost of the acquisition but also the long-term return on investment. Oil and gas assets, particularly exploration and production fields, often require substantial capital expenditure post-acquisition for development, maintenance, and regulatory compliance. Therefore, financial modeling for these deals incorporates not just the price of the acquisition but also the projected cash flows from production, expected commodity price fluctuations, and potential operational risks, including environmental liabilities.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In addition, oil and gas M&A strategies are influenced by broader macroeconomic trends and shifts in global energy policies. The increasing global emphasis on decarbonization and the transition toward cleaner energy sources is reshaping M&A activity in this sector. Companies are under pressure to reduce their carbon footprint, which is leading to a wave of acquisitions aimed at transitioning toward greener technologies. This trend, known as the ‚Äúenergy transition,‚Äù has seen companies like BP, Shell, and Total acquire firms in the renewable energy space or invest in carbon capture and storage technologies as part of their broader strategic realignment. These acquisitions are not merely opportunistic but reflect a strategic imperative to adapt to regulatory changes and societal demands for more sustainable energy solutions.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Risk management is another crucial element of oil and gas M&A strategies. The sector is fraught with operational risks, from fluctuating commodity prices to environmental disasters. M&A transactions provide an opportunity for companies to diversify their risk by acquiring assets in different stages of the value chain, such as upstream (exploration and production), midstream (transportation and storage), and downstream (refining and distribution). A well-diversified portfolio across the value chain allows companies to hedge against downturns in any one segment, thus ensuring more stable revenue streams and mitigating the impact of market shocks.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In conclusion, mergers and acquisitions in the oil and gas industry are multi-faceted strategic tools that enable companies to secure resources, expand their technological capabilities, manage risk, and position themselves for long-term sustainability in a volatile market. Whether driven by asset acquisition, geographic expansion, technological advancement, or portfolio diversification, these transactions require a robust understanding of both financial modeling and the broader strategic landscape of the global energy market. By carefully navigating these factors, companies can not only enhance their operational efficiency but also build the resilience needed to thrive in an increasingly complex and dynamic global energy environment.

# 18.2. Asset Valuation and Reserve Estimations
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In the oil and gas industry, asset valuation is not a straightforward financial calculation but requires an intricate understanding of reserve estimations, production capacity, and future market trends. The valuation process hinges on the ability to evaluate the quality, quantity, and economic viability of the reserves, which directly impacts the long-term profitability of the acquisition.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Reserve estimation is central to this process. Oil and gas reserves are classified into three categories: proven, probable, and possible reserves. Proven reserves represent quantities that are recoverable under existing economic conditions with a high degree of certainty, while probable and possible reserves carry greater levels of uncertainty. Estimating these reserves requires detailed geological surveys, drilling data, and production histories. Companies must use industry-standard methodologies such as the Society of Petroleum Engineers (SPE) guidelines to ensure these estimates are accurate and reliable. Accurate reserve estimation is crucial, as it determines not only the physical feasibility of extraction but also the economic value of the resource over time.
</p>

<div class="row justify-content-center">
    <div class="rounded p-4 position-relative overflow-hidden border-1 text-center" style="width: 70%">
        {{< figure src="/images/5WeQ1hZHBs9V6t4cB9cO-pOhu1aF0PYyQ01T0ejJ8-v1.png" >}}
        <p><strong>Figure 18.2:</strong> Key components of Asset Valuation in oil and gas industry.</p>
    </div>
</div>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The challenge of asset valuation in oil and gas extends beyond merely estimating the volume of reserves. Companies must also factor in the economic feasibility of extracting these resources. This requires a thorough analysis of production capacity, operating costs, and potential revenue streams. Production capacity is influenced by several factors, including the geological characteristics of the reservoir, the technology available for extraction, and the infrastructure required to bring the product to market. Valuations must reflect both the short-term and long-term production potential of the asset, taking into account any technical constraints or operational challenges that could affect the rate of extraction.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The volatility of oil prices is another key consideration in asset valuation. Given the cyclical nature of oil prices, companies must assess future market trends and build flexibility into their valuation models to account for price fluctuations. High oil prices can make marginal reserves economically viable, while low prices can turn profitable reserves into stranded assets. As such, valuation methodologies like discounted cash flow (DCF) are often employed to project future revenue streams under various price scenarios. DCF analysis discounts future cash flows to present value, allowing companies to factor in the time value of money, extraction costs, and potential revenue under different market conditions. This method provides a more comprehensive view of an asset's financial viability by modeling various price points and cost scenarios.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In addition to DCF, net asset value (NAV) is commonly used in the oil and gas industry for valuation purposes. NAV provides a snapshot of a company's or asset's current value by subtracting liabilities from the estimated value of reserves and other assets. This method is particularly useful when comparing the value of different companies or assets within the sector, as it provides a standardized approach to assess the relative worth of each. However, NAV alone is not sufficient to capture the full complexity of oil and gas asset valuations, which is why it is often used in conjunction with other methods, such as risk-adjusted reserve valuation.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Risk-adjusted reserve valuation adds an additional layer of complexity to the valuation process by accounting for the various risks associated with reserve extraction. These risks include not only geological uncertainty but also operational, environmental, and geopolitical risks. For example, assets located in politically unstable regions or in deep-water offshore fields carry significantly higher risk profiles than onshore fields in politically stable environments. Companies must weigh these risks against the potential rewards when valuing an asset, using techniques like sensitivity analysis to test how changes in key variables‚Äîsuch as oil prices, extraction costs, or political stability‚Äîaffect the asset's value.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Geopolitical risk is particularly relevant in the oil and gas industry, where assets are often located in regions subject to political instability, regulatory uncertainty, or trade restrictions. Companies must factor in the potential for regulatory changes, tax implications, or even expropriation when valuing assets in these areas. A robust risk management framework is essential to navigate these uncertainties, and valuations should incorporate risk premiums or discounts based on the geopolitical environment in which the asset is located. This can significantly impact the final valuation and influence the decision to proceed with the acquisition.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Another critical factor in asset valuation is the cost of extraction, which can vary widely depending on the location and type of reserves. Shale gas extraction, for example, involves significantly higher costs due to the need for hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling, while deep-water drilling comes with its own set of technological and operational challenges. These extraction costs, combined with operational expenses, transportation, and environmental compliance costs, must be carefully modeled in the valuation process to ensure a realistic assessment of the asset's profitability. Failure to accurately assess these costs can lead to overvaluations, resulting in financially disastrous acquisitions.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In industry practice, these valuation methods are often used in combination to provide a comprehensive assessment of asset value. For instance, DCF may provide insight into future cash flows, while NAV offers a snapshot of current asset worth, and risk-adjusted reserve valuation allows for a nuanced view of potential risks and rewards. Together, these approaches enable companies to build a robust valuation model that accounts for both the tangible and intangible factors influencing an asset's value.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In conclusion, asset valuation and reserve estimation in the oil and gas industry require a multidimensional approach that integrates geological, economic, and geopolitical factors. Accurate reserve estimations are critical for determining the long-term value of acquired fields, and the use of advanced valuation methodologies such as DCF, NAV, and risk-adjusted reserve valuation ensures that companies can make informed decisions during the M&A process. By combining technical expertise with financial acumen, companies can better assess the worth of oil and gas assets, positioning themselves to navigate the complexities of the industry and maximize the returns on their acquisitions.

# 18.3. Environmental Regulations and Impact Assessments
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In an industry that is heavily regulated and subject to increasing scrutiny, M&A strategies cannot ignore the importance of compliance with environmental regulations. Acquiring companies must navigate a complex landscape of local, national, and international laws, which often vary depending on the geographic location of the assets. A thorough understanding of these regulations and their associated risks is essential not only for the success of the acquisition but also for its long-term sustainability.
</p>

<div class="row justify-content-center">
    <div class="rounded p-4 position-relative overflow-hidden border-1 text-center" style="width: 70%">
        {{< figure src="/images/5WeQ1hZHBs9V6t4cB9cO-ujyIOoQpL3QodAiMHLLI-v1.png" >}}
        <p><strong>Figure 18.3:</strong> Elements of environmental compliance in oil and gas M&A.</p>
    </div>
</div>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Environmental regulations in the oil and gas industry are designed to mitigate the ecological impact of exploration, extraction, transportation, and processing of fossil fuels. These regulations address issues such as air and water pollution, waste management, habitat destruction, and greenhouse gas emissions. In many cases, non-compliance with these laws can result in significant financial penalties, operational delays, and even the suspension of projects. Therefore, acquiring companies must ensure that the target‚Äôs assets are fully compliant with existing environmental regulations. This often involves a comprehensive environmental impact assessment (EIA), a process that evaluates the potential environmental effects of the acquisition and identifies any necessary mitigation measures.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) provides one of the most stringent regulatory frameworks for oil and gas operations. The EPA‚Äôs regulations cover a wide range of environmental issues, including the Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act, and the Safe Drinking Water Act, which impose limits on emissions, water contamination, and hazardous waste disposal. When conducting M&A in the U.S., companies must assess whether the target‚Äôs operations comply with these federal standards, as well as state-level regulations, which can be even more stringent. A failure to meet EPA standards can result in fines, mandatory shutdowns, and costly remediation efforts, all of which can negatively impact the financial viability of the acquisition. The EIA, in this context, is a critical tool for identifying potential regulatory risks and determining whether the acquisition can meet the necessary compliance requirements.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In the European Union, environmental regulations are similarly stringent, with an emphasis on sustainability and the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. The EU‚Äôs regulatory framework is largely influenced by its commitment to global sustainability initiatives, such as the Paris Agreement, which sets targets for carbon reduction. As part of the EU‚Äôs efforts to transition to a low-carbon economy, oil and gas companies are subject to the Emissions Trading System (ETS), which imposes caps on carbon emissions and requires companies to purchase allowances for the emissions they produce. For M&A activities in Europe, acquiring companies must consider the long-term financial implications of the ETS and other carbon pricing mechanisms, as these can significantly affect the profitability of the target‚Äôs assets. Moreover, compliance with the EU‚Äôs environmental directives, such as the Industrial Emissions Directive (IED), which governs emissions from large industrial installations, is essential for avoiding legal liabilities and operational disruptions.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In addition to regional regulatory frameworks, global environmental initiatives play a growing role in shaping oil and gas M&A strategies. The Paris Agreement, adopted by nearly all nations, sets forth goals to limit global warming and requires countries to establish nationally determined contributions (NDCs) to reduce emissions. Many oil and gas companies are increasingly aligning their operations with these global targets, driven by both regulatory pressures and investor demands for more sustainable business practices. Acquiring companies must assess the extent to which the target‚Äôs operations comply with international climate goals and whether additional investments will be required to meet these commitments. This is particularly relevant in light of the growing emphasis on environmental, social, and governance (ESG) criteria, which investors use to evaluate the long-term sustainability of companies.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Environmental impact assessments (EIAs) serve as a critical component of the M&A process, providing a detailed evaluation of the potential environmental risks associated with the acquisition. The EIA process involves multiple stages, including scoping, where the environmental effects of the proposed acquisition are identified; impact analysis, which assesses the magnitude of these effects; and mitigation planning, where strategies to minimize adverse environmental impacts are developed. The EIA not only ensures that the acquiring company is aware of the environmental liabilities associated with the acquisition but also helps to identify opportunities for improving the sustainability of the target‚Äôs operations. For example, the EIA might reveal the need for updated infrastructure to reduce emissions or more efficient waste management practices to comply with regulatory standards.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
A well-conducted EIA can prevent costly fines, project delays, and reputational damage, which are common risks in the oil and gas sector. Environmental liabilities can arise from a variety of sources, including legacy contamination from previous operations, failure to meet current regulatory standards, or exposure to future regulatory changes. The costs associated with environmental remediation‚Äîsuch as cleaning up contaminated land, restoring ecosystems, or paying for carbon credits‚Äîcan be substantial and must be factored into the overall valuation of the target. Companies that fail to account for these risks may find themselves facing unexpected costs that can erode the financial benefits of the acquisition.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
From an industry practices perspective, many oil and gas companies are now incorporating sustainability and environmental risk management into their core M&A strategies. This shift is driven by increasing stakeholder expectations for responsible corporate behavior, as well as the financial and operational risks associated with environmental non-compliance. Investors, particularly those focused on long-term value creation, are placing greater emphasis on ESG criteria and are more likely to support acquisitions that demonstrate a clear commitment to environmental stewardship. As a result, M&A strategies in the oil and gas sector are increasingly focused on acquiring assets that align with the acquiring company‚Äôs sustainability goals, such as renewable energy assets or companies with strong environmental track records.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In conclusion, environmental regulations and impact assessments are integral to the M&A process in the oil and gas industry. Acquiring companies must navigate a complex web of local, national, and international regulations to ensure compliance and avoid environmental liabilities. Thorough environmental impact assessments are essential for identifying potential risks, ensuring regulatory compliance, and promoting the long-term sustainability of the acquisition. By integrating environmental considerations into their M&A strategies, companies can protect themselves from costly legal and operational risks while also positioning themselves to meet the growing demand for sustainable energy practices in an increasingly regulated global market.

# 18.4. Infrastructure Integration and Operational Safety
<p style="text-align: justify;">
The integration of infrastructure in the oil and gas industry‚Äîranging from pipelines and refineries to drilling platforms and storage facilities‚Äîpresents significant logistical and technical challenges that require meticulous planning and execution. M&A deals in this sector often involve combining extensive physical assets, which must operate seamlessly post-merger to avoid costly disruptions, inefficiencies, and safety risks.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The first challenge in infrastructure integration is ensuring compatibility between the acquired assets and the acquirer‚Äôs existing infrastructure. Oil and gas operations rely on complex networks of pipelines, processing plants, and distribution facilities, and these systems must function together efficiently. Differences in technology, operational protocols, and maintenance standards between the acquiring and target companies can create bottlenecks or inefficiencies if not properly addressed. A thorough technical due diligence process is essential to identify potential areas of misalignment, such as incompatible pipeline materials, differing refinery capacities, or outdated safety systems. During the integration process, companies may need to invest in upgrades or modifications to ensure that newly acquired assets meet the standards of the acquirer‚Äôs existing infrastructure and adhere to industry best practices.
</p>

<div class="row justify-content-center">
    <div class="rounded p-4 position-relative overflow-hidden border-1 text-center" style="width: 80%">
        {{< figure src="/images/5WeQ1hZHBs9V6t4cB9cO-CrARC6VNT7LEPOgK0DkS-v1.png" >}}
        <p><strong>Figure 18.4:</strong> Operational success steps for infrastructure integration in oil and gas M&A.</p>
    </div>
</div>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Operational safety is paramount in the oil and gas sector, given the hazardous nature of the industry and the strict regulatory oversight it faces. The integration of infrastructure must prioritize safety to prevent accidents, environmental disasters, and regulatory violations. The oil and gas industry operates in high-risk environments, including offshore drilling platforms, chemical processing plants, and pipeline networks that transport volatile hydrocarbons. The potential for accidents, such as oil spills, explosions, and equipment failures, means that operational safety cannot be compromised during the integration of new assets. Therefore, companies must conduct comprehensive risk assessments to identify safety vulnerabilities in the acquired infrastructure and implement necessary safety protocols to address these risks.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
One of the key strategies for maintaining operational safety during infrastructure integration is adopting standardized safety management systems across all assets. Many companies in the oil and gas sector use systems such as the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) guidelines or the International Organization for Standardization‚Äôs ISO 45001 framework for occupational health and safety. When integrating infrastructure, it is critical to ensure that these safety standards are uniformly applied to both the acquiring and acquired companies‚Äô assets. This can involve retraining staff, upgrading safety equipment, and harmonizing safety procedures across operations. For example, if the target company‚Äôs safety protocols for offshore drilling do not align with the acquirer‚Äôs more stringent standards, those protocols must be revised to prevent accidents and ensure compliance with regulatory requirements.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Regulatory compliance is another major consideration in infrastructure integration. The oil and gas industry is subject to strict environmental, safety, and operational regulations, and non-compliance can result in significant fines, legal liabilities, and reputational damage. Post-merger, companies must ensure that all newly acquired infrastructure meets the regulatory standards of the regions in which they operate. This may involve upgrading equipment to meet emission standards, installing more advanced monitoring systems to detect leaks or malfunctions, and improving waste management practices to comply with environmental regulations. In regions such as the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Department of Transportation‚Äôs Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) impose rigorous standards for pipeline safety and emissions control, while the European Union enforces strict regulations under the Industrial Emissions Directive (IED) and the Seveso Directive for chemical plant safety.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In addition to safety and regulatory considerations, minimizing operational downtime during the integration process is critical for ensuring that the merged entity can maintain production levels and profitability. Merging oil and gas infrastructure often requires shutting down certain facilities temporarily to implement upgrades, transfer control systems, or realign pipelines and processing capacities. However, extended downtime can lead to production delays, revenue loss, and even market share erosion. Companies must therefore develop detailed integration plans that balance the need for infrastructure upgrades with the goal of minimizing disruption to ongoing operations. This often involves staging the integration process in phases, so that critical assets remain operational while non-essential systems are upgraded or aligned.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Managing high-risk environments, such as offshore drilling platforms and chemical processing facilities, requires particular attention during the integration process. Offshore drilling, for example, presents unique challenges due to the remote location, harsh environmental conditions, and the complexity of the extraction process. Integrating offshore platforms with onshore processing and distribution networks necessitates not only technical compatibility but also the coordination of safety measures across different environments. Offshore drilling is governed by strict regulations, such as those enforced by the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE) in the U.S., and integrating these platforms into an existing operational network requires adherence to these regulatory frameworks. Similarly, chemical processing facilities, which handle volatile substances and operate at high temperatures and pressures, must undergo rigorous safety checks and process audits to ensure that they are aligned with the acquirer‚Äôs operational safety standards.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Best practices for managing high-risk environments during integration include conducting thorough hazard and operability studies (HAZOPs) and safety audits to identify potential risks and develop mitigation strategies. For instance, if the acquired infrastructure includes chemical processing plants that handle hazardous materials, the company must ensure that safety protocols are in place to prevent leaks, explosions, or chemical spills. These protocols may include automated safety shutdown systems, regular equipment maintenance schedules, and enhanced monitoring systems to detect abnormal operating conditions.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In addition to technical and safety concerns, human factors play a critical role in the successful integration of oil and gas infrastructure. The acquisition process often involves combining workforces from both companies, each with its own operational culture and safety practices. Ensuring that all employees are trained to the same safety and operational standards is essential for maintaining a safe working environment. This may require cross-training, employee onboarding programs, and leadership alignment to promote a unified safety culture across the newly integrated organization.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In conclusion, infrastructure integration and operational safety are fundamental challenges in oil and gas M&A. The successful merging of pipelines, refineries, and other critical infrastructure requires a strategic approach that balances technical compatibility, operational safety, regulatory compliance, and minimal downtime. By adhering to industry best practices for safety management, risk mitigation, and regulatory alignment, companies can ensure that their M&A activities lead to long-term operational success while safeguarding both their employees and the environment. Managing high-risk environments, such as offshore drilling platforms and chemical plants, demands a heightened focus on safety and regulatory compliance, underscoring the complexity and importance of this aspect of oil and gas M&A.
