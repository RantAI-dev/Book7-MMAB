#### **6. Data Room**

A secure virtual or physical space where confidential documents are shared between parties during the due diligence phase of M&A. Digital M&A deals often utilize virtual data rooms (VDRs) for real-time collaboration and document sharing.

#### **7. Decommissioning Costs**

Expenses associated with the closure and dismantling of oil production facilities, pipelines, and other infrastructure, typically factored into Oil & Gas M&A transactions as potential liabilities.

#### **8. Due Diligence**

A comprehensive appraisal of a target company’s assets, liabilities, operations, and financial performance before a deal is completed. Due diligence is critical in both Digital and Oil & Gas M&A to assess risks such as intellectual property rights or environmental liabilities.

#### **9. Earn-Out**

A contractual provision that allows the seller to earn additional compensation based on the future performance of the acquired company. Common in the Digital industry, especially when acquiring startups with high growth potential.

#### **10. Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA)**

A process to evaluate the environmental consequences of a proposed project, particularly important in Oil & Gas M&A to comply with environmental regulations and assess risks.

#### **11. Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) System**

An integrated suite of software applications used to manage day-to-day business activities such as accounting, procurement, and supply chain operations. ERP system integration is a key factor in post-merger IT consolidation in both industries.

#### **12. Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG)**

Refers to a set of standards for a company’s operations that socially conscious investors use to screen potential investments. ESG considerations are critical in both Digital and Oil & Gas M&A for long-term sustainability.

#### **13. Exploration and Production (E&P)**

The sector of the Oil & Gas industry that deals with the exploration and extraction of crude oil and natural gas. In M&A, E&P assets are often key targets for acquisition due to their future revenue potential.

#### **14. Horizontal Integration**

A type of merger or acquisition where a company acquires a competitor in the same industry. In Digital M&A, this often involves acquiring companies with similar products, while in Oil & Gas, it may involve acquiring additional fields or refineries.

#### **15. Intellectual Property (IP)**

Legally recognized creations of the mind, such as inventions, patents, and trademarks. In the Digital sector, IP assets are often a primary driver of M&A, with acquirers seeking to gain ownership of valuable technologies or software.

#### **16. Joint Venture (JV)**

A business arrangement in which two or more parties agree to combine their resources for a specific project. JVs are common in the Oil & Gas sector to share risks and resources for exploration and production in challenging regions.

#### **17. Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG)**

Natural gas that has been cooled to a liquid state for ease of storage or transport. LNG facilities and infrastructure are often targets in Oil & Gas M&A deals, particularly with increasing global demand for natural gas.

#### **18. Minority Interest**

The ownership stake in a company held by investors who do not control the business. Understanding minority interest is important in M&A when evaluating the power dynamics of shareholders.

#### **19. Net Asset Value (NAV)**

A method used to value oil and gas companies, often based on the future revenues and costs associated with their exploration and production assets. NAV is critical for valuing resource-heavy businesses in the Oil & Gas industry.

#### **20. Non-Compete Agreement**

A contract that restricts a seller from competing with the buyer’s business for a specific period of time post-transaction. These are common in both Digital and Oil & Gas M&A to protect the acquired business's competitive advantage.

#### **21. Offtake Agreement**

A contract between a producer and buyer for the purchase and sale of future production, typically seen in Oil & Gas deals. Offtake agreements provide guaranteed revenue streams and can influence M&A valuations.

#### **22. Pipeline**

In the Oil & Gas sector, pipelines are a critical infrastructure for transporting crude oil and natural gas. In M&A, the valuation of pipelines and transportation infrastructure can significantly impact the deal’s value.

#### **23. Post-Merger Integration (PMI)**

The process of combining two companies after an acquisition is complete. PMI involves integrating IT systems, aligning operations, and unifying cultures in both Digital and Oil & Gas M&A transactions.

#### **24. Proved Reserves**

Estimated quantities of oil and gas that geological and engineering data demonstrate to be recoverable under existing economic and operational conditions. Proved reserves are a critical valuation component in Oil & Gas M&A.

#### **25. Renewable Energy Assets**

Refers to assets like wind farms, solar plants, and hydroelectric facilities that produce energy from renewable sources. In the Oil & Gas sector, acquiring renewable energy assets is becoming more common as companies diversify their portfolios.

#### **26. Reverse Takeover**

A process where a private company acquires a public company, effectively allowing the private company to become publicly traded. This is common in the Digital industry when startups seek quick access to public markets.

#### **27. Royalty**

Payments made to landowners or governments based on the extraction of resources, such as oil or gas. Understanding royalty obligations is critical in Oil & Gas M&A as it affects the long-term profitability of extraction operations.

#### **28. Share Purchase Agreement (SPA)**

A contract between the buyer and seller that finalizes the terms and conditions of a transaction. In both Digital and Oil & Gas M&A, SPAs cover key elements such as the purchase price, payment structure, and representations and warranties.

#### **29. Synergies**

The additional value created by merging two companies, often through cost savings or increased revenues. In Digital M&A, synergies often come from integrating technology platforms, while in Oil & Gas, they may result from shared infrastructure or supply chains.
